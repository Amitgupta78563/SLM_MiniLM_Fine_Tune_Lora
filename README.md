# SLM_MiniLM_Fine_Tune_Lora_Intent_Classification
I used lora fine tune using PEPT library to train MiniLM slm for customer support dataset to classify the intent of the conversation, where i did multiple experiment with multiple hyperparameter for lora configuration, and training configuration. Tuned it to the accuracy of almost 90%
